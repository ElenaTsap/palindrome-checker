Stacks

A stack is a basic data structure where you can only insert or delete items at the top of the stack. It is kind of similar to a stack of books. If you want to look at a book in the middle of the stack you must take all of the books above it off first.

The stack is considered LIFO (Last In First Out) — meaning the last item you put in the stack is the first item that comes out of the stack

There are three main operations that can be performed on stacks: inserting an item into a stack (called ‘push’), deleting an item from the stack (called ‘pop’), and displaying the contents of the stack (sometimes called ‘pip’).
